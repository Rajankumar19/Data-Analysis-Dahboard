# Data-Analysis-Dahboard
This project analyzes hospital workflow, patient admissions, diagnosis, billing, and doctor feedback.
Using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, we created an interactive dashboard to monitor:

#Dataset used 
- <a href="https://github.com/Rajankumar19/Data-Analysis-Dahboard/blob/22dead4ddec696b23a0b375fcd20288fcdb686e2/Healtcare-Dataset.xlsx"> Dataset </a>

## Key Questions (KPIs)
1.Bed Occupancy:
-How many patients were admitted to Private, General, and ICU wards?.
2.Billing & Insurance:
-What is the total hospital billing vs. insurance coverage across diagnosis types?.
-Which diagnosis contributes the most to hospital revenue?.
3.Diagnosis Insights:
-Which diseases (Flu, Malaria, Viral Infection, Typhoid, etc.) are most common?.
-How is the case distribution changing over time?.
4.Doctor Feedback:
-Which doctors received the highest patient feedback volume?.
-How balanced is the workload among doctors?.
5.Timeline Analysis:
-What are the average admission-to-discharge durations?.
-How many follow-ups occur after discharge?.

##Process
1.Data Preparation (Excel / Power Query)
-Cleaned and transformed raw healthcare dataset.
-Standardized column names, data types, and dates.
-Created calculated fields (Billing vs Insurance Gap, Length of Stay).

2.Data Modeling (Power BI)
-Built relationships between patient, doctor, and diagnosis data.
-Created measures using DAX (e.g., Total Billing, Insurance Coverage %).

3.Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)
-KPI Cards: Admit Date, Discharge Date, Follow-up Date, Billing Amount.
-Bar Charts: Bed Occupancy, Diagnosis Type.
-Pie Chart: Doctor Feedback Volume.
-Line Chart: Billing vs. Insurance trends by Diagnosis.
-Filters: Date range, Patient_ID.
